## Overview

Dictionary app inspired by codingNepal


### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- Search any word of their choice and get the meaning, example, synonyms and pronunciation of the word.
- Incase the example or synonyms of the word typed in is not available, the display of the parentElement is set to a display of none.
- On input validity, the removal icon appears and can be used to erase the word typed in.
- Clicking the synonyms of the typed in word redirect the users to the meaning, example and synonyms of that word.
